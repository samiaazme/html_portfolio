<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I’m Samia Azme, an introverted soul who has a passion for Computer Science, 
  having completed my undergraduate degree from the Department of CSE. I find peace in the quiet moments
  and love to connect with nature. When I'm not immersed in tech, you’ll likely find me enjoying the beauty
  of the moon or indulging in a piece of chocolate. I’m a fan of every colors and appreciate the little things in life that bring joy, 
  but I’m not one for crowds—I much prefer the serenity of being outdoors.</p>

<p> I love cycling through scenic routes, especially during the spring season when nature is in full bloom.
  I’m deeply connected to nature and find peace in its beauty, preferring calmness over crowds. 
  Though I’m an introvert at heart, I have big dreams and am determined to turn them into reality. 
  Every day is another step toward fulfilling those dreams!</p>
